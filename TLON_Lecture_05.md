# The Language of Negotiation - Ethics

1. You are selling your e-bike to raise money for an upcoming trip overseas.

-	Is it ethical to say you have another offer, when there is no other offer?

2. To gain inside knowledge of a competitor’s business, you have a consultant call and ask about problems or threats in the company.

-	Is this an ethical way to learn about the competitor’s company?

3. When selling your laptop, you decide not to tell buyers the computer crashes without warning.

-	Is this ethical?  Would you be likely to do this?

4. You buy a new pair of shoes on sale (no returns) but you make a scene in the store and the manager refunds your money.

-	Is this ethical?  Would you be likely to do this?

Is this ethical?

### Ethics defined

Ethics are broadly applied social standards for what is right or wrong in a particular situation, or a process for setting those standards.

-	Differ from morals, which are individual and personal beliefs.

Choose a course of action on the basis of results, duty, community norms, or personal convictions.

**End-result ethics**

- the rightness of an action is determined by evaluating the pros and cons of its consequences.

**Duty ethics**

- the rightness of an action is determined by an obligation to adhere to principles, laws, and social standards that define what is right and wrong and where the line is.

**Social contract ethics**

- the rightness of an action is based on the customs and norms of a particular community.

**Personalistic ethics**

- the rightness of the action is based on one’s own conscience and moral standards.

### Applying ehtical reasoning to negotiation

Using the situation from the start of the chapter involving selling an e-bike and the statement to a prospective buyer about the existance of another potential buyer.

> If you believe in **end-result** ethics, then you might do whatever is necessary to get the best possible outcome (including lie).

> If you believe in **duty** ethics, you might perceive an obligation never to engage in subterfuge and might reject a tactic that involves an outright lie.

> In **social contract** ethics, you base your tactics on appropriate conduct in your community; if others would use deception in a situation like this, you will too.

> In **personalistic** ethics, your conscience decides if your need for cash for your upcoming trip justifies using deceptive or dishonest tactics.
