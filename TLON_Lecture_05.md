# The Language of Negotiation - Ethics

1. You are selling your e-bike to raise money for an upcoming trip overseas.

-	Is it ethical to say you have another offer, when there is no other offer?

2. To gain inside knowledge of a competitor’s business, you have a consultant call and ask about problems or threats in the company.

-	Is this an ethical way to learn about the competitor’s company?

3. When selling your laptop, you decide not to tell buyers the computer crashes without warning.

-	Is this ethical?  Would you be likely to do this?

4. You buy a new pair of shoes on sale (no returns) but you make a scene in the store and the manager refunds your money.

-	Is this ethical?  Would you be likely to do this?

Is this ethical?

    [[Ethical][Unethical][Would][Wouldn't]]
    [                                         ] e-bike
    [                                         ] competitor
    [                                         ] laptop
    [                                         ] shoes

### Ethics defined

Ethics are broadly applied social standards for what is right or wrong in a particular situation, or a process for setting those standards.

-	Differ from morals, which are individual and personal beliefs.

Choose a course of action on the basis of results, duty, community norms, or personal convictions.

**End-result ethics**

- the rightness of an action is determined by evaluating the pros and cons of its consequences.

**Duty ethics**

- the rightness of an action is determined by an obligation to adhere to principles, laws, and social standards that define what is right and wrong and where the line is.

**Social contract ethics**

- the rightness of an action is based on the customs and norms of a particular community.

**Personalistic ethics**

- the rightness of the action is based on one’s own conscience and moral standards.

### Applying ehtical reasoning to negotiation

Using the situation from the start of the chapter involving selling an e-bike and the statement to a prospective buyer about the existance of another potential buyer.

> If you believe in **end-result** ethics, then you might do whatever is necessary to get the best possible outcome (including lie).

> If you believe in **duty** ethics, you might perceive an obligation never to engage in subterfuge and might reject a tactic that involves an outright lie.

> In **social contract** ethics, you base your tactics on appropriate conduct in your community; if others would use deception in a situation like this, you will too.

> In **personalistic** ethics, your conscience decides if your need for cash for your upcoming trip justifies using deceptive or dishonest tactics.

### Ethics v. Prudence v. Practicality v. Legality

Ethical.

- Appropriate as determined by some standard of moral conduct.

Prudent.

- Wise, based on trying to understand the efficiency of the tactic and the consequences it might have on the relationship with the other.

Practical.

- What a negotiator can actually make happen in a given situation.

Legal. 

- What the law defines as acceptable practice.

### Ethical conduct in negotiation

Why do some negotiators use unethical tactics?

-	The first answer – immoral – may be too simplistic.

-	People regard other people’s unsavory behavior as due to personality and attribute their own behavior to factors in the social environment.

-	A negotiator might consider an opponent’s use of an ethically questionable tactic as unprincipled.

-	In contrast, if the negotiator uses the same tactic themselves, they tend to say they have a good reason for deviating from principles, this one time.

The following section discusses negotiation tactics that bring issues of ethicality into play.

### Ethically ambiguous tactics and truth

Ethically ambiguous tactics may or may not be improper, depending on an individual’s ethical reasoning and circumstances.

-	Questions about truth telling are clear, but not the answers.

-	How do you define truth?  How do you define deviations from the truth?

Effective agreements depend on sharing accurate information but negotiators want to disclose little about their positions.

> -	The dilemma of trust is that a negotiator who believes everything the other says can be manipulated by dishonesty.
>
> -	The dilemma of honesty is that a negotiator who tells the other party all their requirements will never do better than their walkaway point.

Donahue, “Extending and Testing a Five Factor Model of Ethical and Unethical Bargaining Tactics: The SINS Scale,” Journal of Organizational Behavior 21 (2000), pp. 649–64; and Ingrid S.

### Is it acceptible to use ethically ambiguous tactics?

Acceptible?

[(Yes)] Yes
[(No)] No
[(Fence)] Fence

> There are tacitly agreed-on rules of the game in negotiation.
> 
> - Some minor forms of untruths may be seen as ethically acceptable and within the rules.
> 
> - In contrast, outright deception is generally seen as outside the rules.

The authors offer some caution.

-	Statements are based on large groups of people and do not indicate or predict any individual negotiator’s use of such tactics.

-	Observations are based on what people said they would do, rather than what they actually did.

-	By reporting the results, the authors do not endorse the use of marginally ethical tactics.

-	This is a Western view of negotiation, not true for other cultures – “let the buyer beware” at all times.

### Deception by omission versus commission

The use of deceptive tactics can be active or passive.

For example, misrepresenting your interest on a common-value issue in order to obtain a future concession from the other party.

> Negotiators use two forms of deception in misrepresenting the common-value issue:
> 
> - Misrepresentation by omission – failing to disclose information that would benefit the other party.
> 
> - Misrepresentation by commission – actually lying about the issue.

> A student role-play study involving the sale of a car with a defective transmission revealed the following insight.
> 
> - Students could lie by omission or commission.
> 
> - Far more students were willing to lie by omission.
