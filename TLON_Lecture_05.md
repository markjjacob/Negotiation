# The Language of Negotiation - Ethics

You are selling your e-bike to raise money for an upcoming trip overseas.

•	Is it ethical to say you have another offer, when there is no other offer?

To gain inside knowledge of a competitor’s business, you have a consultant call and ask about problems or threats in the company.

•	Is this an ethical way to learn about the competitor’s company?

When selling your laptop, you decide not to tell buyers the computer crashes without warning.

•	Is this ethical?  Would you be likely to do this?

You buy a new pair of shoes on sale (no returns) but you make a scene in the store and the manager refunds your money.

•	Is this ethical?  Would you be likely to do this?
