# The Language of Negotiation - Finding and Using Negotiation Power

## Why is Power Important to Negotiators?

Seeking power in negotiation arises from one of two perceptions.

- The negotiator believes they have less power than the other party.
- The negotiator believes they need more power than the other party.

> There are questions of tactics and motives.
>
> -  Tactics may enhance a negotiator’s own power or diminish the other’s power.
> - Motives are why the negotiator uses tactics.
>
>  - Commonly, negotiators create power differences to gain advantage or to block the other party’s power moves.
>  - Negotiators may employ tactics to create power equalization as a way to level the playing field.

> In general, those less concerned with power, or those with matching power, have easier deliberations and reach acceptable outcomes.

## Interests, Rights and Power in Negotiation

Negotiators focus on *interests* when they strive to learn about about each other’s interests and priorities as a way to agreements that create value.
Negotiators focus on *rights* when they seek to resolve disputes by drawing on rules or standards grounded in law, or on existing contracts.
Negotiators focus on *power* when they use threats or other means to coerce the other party into making concessions.

- Negotiators cycle through all three strategies during the same encounter and tend to reciprocate these strategies.

  - Starting a negotiation by conveying power can bring quick settlements if your threat is credible.
  - Power (and rights) tactics may be most useful when the other party refuses to negotiate or when negotiations need to be restarted.
  - The success of power (and rights) tactics depends on how they are implemented.

## A Definition of Power

Power used to dominate and control the other (distributive bargaining).

- From the power holder’s perspective—power over.
- The receiver feels powerless and dependent.

Power used to work together (integrative negotiation).

- The power holder has power with the other.
- The receiver feels empowered and independent.

*Environmental power* or “A is more able to influence his environment than is B.”

*Relationship power* or “A is able to influence B more than B is able to do with A.”

*Personal power* or “A is usually more able to satisfy his desires than is B.”

> Effective use of power requires a sensitive and deft touch.
>
> Not only do actors and targets change by situation, but the context changes as well.

## Sources of Power—How People Acquire Power

Expert power.

- Derived from having unique information about a subject.

Reward power.

- Derived from being able to reward others.

Coercive power.

- Derived from being able to punish others.

Legitimate power.

- Derived from a formal title.

Referent power.

- Derived from respect.

> This lecture takes a broader perspective on power.
>
> - Informational sources of power.
> - Power based on personality and individual differences.
> - Power based on position in an organization.
> - Relationship-based sources of power.
> - Contextual sources of power.

### Informational Sources of Power

Information power comes from a negotiator’s ability to assemble and organize data to support their position, arguments, or desired outcomes.
In negotiation, it is the most important source of power.

> The exchange of information is also at the heart of the concession-making process.
>
> - A common definition of the situation emerges and serves as a rationale for both sides to modify their positions and, eventually, arrive at a mutually acceptable agreement.

> Power derived from expertise is a special form of information power.

### Power Based on Personality and Individual Differences

Cognitive orientation.

- The *unity* frame believes society is an integrated whole.
- The *radical* frame believes society is a continual clash of interests.
- The *pluralist* frame believes power is equally distributed.

Motivation orientation.

- Focus on “energizing elements” of the personality rather than ideology.

Dispositions and related skills.

- Grounded in dispositions to be cooperative or competitive.

Moral orientation toward power.

- Individuals differ in their moral views about power and its use.

Moods.

- Moods can create power and power enhances the impact of emotional expression.

### Power Based on Position in an Organization (Structural Power)

Here we discuss two different approaches to structure that can influence negotiating power.

- The first way is consistent with more traditional approaches to organizational structure.

  - A hierarchy of jobs forming a traditional organizational chart.

- The second way is consistent with a newer approach to organizational structure that considers networks.

  - It shows how a negotiator’s location in a network can contribute to bargaining power.

### Power Derived from Traditional Organizational Hierarchy

Legitimate power is derived from a position in a hierarchy.

- The foundation of our social structure, acquired by:

  - Birth.
  - Election.
  - Appointment.
  - Legitimate authority.

- Cannot function without consent of the governed.

- There is also the legitimate power of reciprocity, equity, and responsibility or dependence.

Resource power is derived from the capacity to give or withhold resources—such as:

- Money, supplies, human capital, time, equipment, critical services, or support.

Controlling resources is a major power source in organizations.

- Rewards and punishments can be tangible or intangible.
- You must deal with the powerholder.
- Powerholder must be willing to allocate resources depending on compliance or cooperation.

### Power Based on Location in a Network

In a network, the lines (ties) represent flows and connect individuals or groups (nodes) who actually interact with each other.

Tie strength is the strength of relationships with others.

- Stronger ties indicate greater power to influence the other.

Tie content is the resource that passes along the tie with another person.

- If content builds the relationship, ties create trust and gain strength.

Network structure is the overall set of relationships within a social system.

- Centrality holds power for the node’s occupant.
- Criticality and relevance is if the information is essential.
- Flexibility is if the individual has discretion to who gains access.
- Visibility is if the task is visible to others.
- A node can be a member of a coalition or subgroup.

### Power Based on Relationships

Goal interdependence has a strong impact on how likely parties will be to constructively use power.

- Cooperative goals shape the “power with” orientation.

  - Induces expectations of assistance, greater support, persuasion over coercion, and trusting attitudes.

- Competitive goals shape a “power over” orientation.

  - Enhances power differences and the use of power to achieve personal goals.

Referent power is based on an appeal to common experiences, a common past or fate, or membership in the same group.

- More salient when one party uses the commonality to increase their power.
- Referent power can be negative.

  - Used when parties seek to create distance between themselves and others.
  - Or to label the other.

### Contextual Sources of Power

A strong BATNA is a source of power.

- It increases the likelihood of making a first offer.
- It increases your outcomes when compared to not having a BATNA.
- It provides leverage and confidence—don’t have to agree to the offer.
- Leads to a sense of entitlement and higher aspirations.

> Culture shapes what kinds of power are seen as legitimate and how people react to influence.
>
> - May contain rules about use of power.
> - Differ in degree of power orientation.
> - “Power distance” differs by national culture.
> - Culture translates into embedded structural inequalities in a society.

> Agents, constituencies, and external audiences can significantly change the power dynamics.

## Dealing With Others Who Have More Power

Never do an all-or-nothing deal.

- Diversify risk by entering into deals with several partners.

Make the other party smaller.

- Establish relationships to “divide and conquer.

Make yourself bigger.

- Build coalitions to increase your bargaining power.
- Avoid aggression.

Build momentum through doing deals in sequence.

- Early deals build relationships.

Use the power of competition to leverage power.

- Make offers to various players to get them competing for it.
Constrain yourself.

- Limit the ways you can do business or with whom.

Good information is always a source of power.

- Seek what strengthens your case.

Ask diagnostic questions to gain more information.

Do what you can to manage the process and control the direction.
