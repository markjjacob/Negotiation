# The Language of Negotiation - Perception, Cognition, Emotion

## Chapter Overview

We begin by examining how psychological **perception** is related to the process of negotiation, with attention to forms of perceptual distortion.

We then look at how negotiators use information to make decisions about tactics and strategy—the process of **cognition**.

- First, we focus on framing—the strategic use of information to define and articulate a negotiating issue or situation.  
- Second, we discuss cognitive biases in information processing.

We experience and express **emotion** when we interact with others and negotiating is certainly no exception.

- In the final section, we discuss the role of moods and emotions in negotiation—both as causes of behavior and as consequences of negotiated outcomes.

## Perception Defined

Perception is the process by which individuals connect to their environment, by ascribing meaning to messages and events.

Perception is a “sense-making” process where people interpret their environment so they can respond appropriately.

### Perceptual Distortion

> *Stereotyping*

- Occurs when a person assigns attributes to another solely on the basis of the other'S social or demographic category.
- Once formwd, sterotypes can be highly resistant to change

> *Halo effects*

- Occur when people generalize about a variety of attributes based on the knowledge of one attribute of the individual.
- Can be positive or negative.

> *Selective perveption*

- Occurs when perceivers single out supporting information and filter out information that does not confirm their beliefs.
- Perpetuates sterotypes or halo effects.

> Projection

- Occurs when people assign to others the characteristics or feelings that they possess themselves.
- Usually arises out of a need to project one's own self-concept

### Framing

A frame is a subjective mechanism allowing people to evaluate situations, leading them to pursue or avoid subsequent actions.

- Two or more people involved in the same situation or in a complex problem often see it or define it in different ways.
- These frames can change depending on perspective, or they can change over time.

How parties frame an issue is a reflection of:

- WHat they see as critical to their objectives
- Their outcome expectations and preferences.
- What information they need to argue their case.
- Procedures they use to present their case.
- The manner in which they evaluate outcomes.

> Frames are inevitable, occurring without any real intention by the negotiator.

### Types of frames

| Type of Frame    | Definition                 |
| ---------------- |:--------------------------:|
| Substantive      | What the conflict is about |
| Outcome          | A party's predisposition to achieving a specific result or outcome from the negotiation |
| Aspiration       | A predisposition to satisfying a broader set of interests or needs in negotiation |
| Process          | How the parties will go about resolving their dispute |
| Identity         | How the parties define who they are |    
| Characterization | How the parties define the other parties |
| Loss or gain     | How the parties define the risk or reward associated with particular outcomes |

### How frames work in negotiation

- Negotiators can use more than one frame.
- Mismatches in frames between parties are sources of conflict.
- Parties negotiate differently depending on the frame.
- Specific frames may be likely to be used with certain types of issues.
- Particular types of frames may lead to particular types of agreements.
- Parties are likely to assume a particular frame because of various factors.
  - Differences in values, personality, power, or background and social context may lead parties to adopt different frames.

### Another approach to frames: interests rights and power

An influential approach to framing disputes suggests that parties in conflict use one of three frames:

- Interests.

  - People are often concerned about what they need, desire, or want.

- Rights.

  - People may also be concerned about who is “right”—that is, who has legitimacy, who is correct, or what is fair.

- Power.

  - Power is sometimes based on who is physically stronger, but more often, it is about imposing other types of costs – economic pressures, expertise, legitimate authority, and so on.

The way a party frames the problem will likely influence how the other party responds.

### The frame of an issue changes as the negotiation evolves
