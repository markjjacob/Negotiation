# The Language of Negotiation - Perception, Cognition, Emotion

We begin by examining how psychological **perception** is related to the process of negotiation, with attention to forms of perceptual distortion.

We then look at how negotiators use information to make decisions about tactics and strategy—the process of **cognition**.

- First, we focus on framing—the strategic use of information to define and articulate a negotiating issue or situation.  
- Second, we discuss cognitive biases in information processing.

We experience and express **emotion** when we interact with others and negotiating is certainly no exception.

- In the final section, we discuss the role of moods and emotions in negotiation—both as causes of behavior and as consequences of negotiated outcomes.

## Perception

Perception is the process by which individuals connect to their environment, by ascribing meaning to messages and events.

Perception is a “sense-making” process where people interpret their environment so they can respond appropriately.

> Environments are typically complex, so as perceivers we become selective

### Your perception

Would you ...?

    [[Yes][No][Maybe]]
    [                                         ] ask them to look after your bag
    [                                         ] lend them your bike
    [                                         ] accept an invitation for a drink

### Perceptual Distortion

> *Stereotyping*

- Occurs when a person assigns attributes to another solely on the basis of the other'S social or demographic category.
- Once formwd, sterotypes can be highly resistant to change

> *Halo effects*

- Occur when people generalize about a variety of attributes based on the knowledge of one attribute of the individual.
- Can be positive or negative.

> *Selective perveption*

- Occurs when perceivers single out supporting information and filter out information that does not confirm their beliefs.
- Perpetuates sterotypes or halo effects.

> Projection

- Occurs when people assign to others the characteristics or feelings that they possess themselves.
- Usually arises out of a need to project one's own self-concept

### Framing

![Framing](https://www.redbearnegotiation.com/hubfs/Depositphotos_168688620_xl-2015-1024x683-landscape-1.jpg)

A frame is a subjective mechanism allowing people to evaluate situations, leading them to pursue or avoid subsequent actions.

- Two or more people involved in the same situation or in a complex problem often see it or define it in different ways.
- These frames can change depending on perspective, or they can change over time.

How parties frame an issue is a reflection of:

- WHat they see as critical to their objectives
- Their outcome expectations and preferences.
- What information they need to argue their case.
- Procedures they use to present their case.
- The manner in which they evaluate outcomes.

> Frames are inevitable, occurring without any real intention by the negotiator.

### Types of frames

| Type of Frame    | Definition                 |
| ---------------- |:--------------------------:|
| Substantive      | What the conflict is about |
| Outcome          | A party's predisposition to achieving a specific result or outcome from the negotiation |
| Aspiration       | A predisposition to satisfying a broader set of interests or needs in negotiation |
| Process          | How the parties will go about resolving their dispute |
| Identity         | How the parties define who they are |    
| Characterization | How the parties define the other parties |
| Loss or gain     | How the parties define the risk or reward associated with particular outcomes |

### How frames work in negotiation

- Negotiators can use more than one frame.
- Mismatches in frames between parties are sources of conflict.
- Parties negotiate differently depending on the frame.
- Specific frames may be likely to be used with certain types of issues.
- Particular types of frames may lead to particular types of agreements.
- Parties are likely to assume a particular frame because of various factors.
  - Differences in values, personality, power, or background and social context may lead parties to adopt different frames.

### Another approach to frames: interests rights and power

An influential approach to framing disputes suggests that parties in conflict use one of three frames:

- Interests.

  - People are often concerned about what they need, desire, or want.

- Rights.

  - People may also be concerned about who is “right”—that is, who has legitimacy, who is correct, or what is fair.

- Power.

  - Power is sometimes based on who is physically stronger, but more often, it is about imposing other types of costs – economic pressures, expertise, legitimate authority, and so on.

The way a party frames the problem will likely influence how the other party responds.

### The frame of an issue changes as the negotiation evolves

Disputes tend to transform through “naming, blaming, and claiming.”

- *Naming* occurs when parties in a dispute label or identify a problem and characterize what it is about.
- *Blaming* occurs next, as the parties try to determine who or what caused the problem.
- Finally, *claiming* occurs when the individual who has the problem decides to confront, file charges, or take some other action against the individual or organization that caused the problem.

Frames are shaped by the bargaining mix.

- Arguing stock issues.
- Arguing the best possible case.
- They may define major shifts and transitions. 
- Finally, multiple agenda items shape frames.

> Critical to issue development is the process of reframing—changes to the thrust, tone, and focus of a conversation.

## Cognitive biases

| Form of bias | Definition |
|--------------|------------|
| Escalation of Commitment | Tendency of an individual to make decisions that persist in pursuing a failing course of action |
| Mythical fixed-pie beliefs | Tendency to see negotiation as a zero-sum or win-lose situation with parties' interests diametrically opposed |
| Anchoring and adjustment | Being overly influenced by a standard or reference point (an anchor) and failing to make adjustments from it |
| Issue framing and risk | Tendency to be unduly influenced by the positive or negative frame through which risks are perceived |
| Information availability | Tendency to overweight information that is easily recalled or otherwise readily available at the expense of information that is critical but less salient |
| The winner's curse | Tendency to settle quickly on an outcome and then feel discomfort about a negotiation win that comes too easily |
| Negotiator overconfidence | Tendency to believe that one's ability to be correct or accurate is greater than is actually the case |
| The law of small numbers | Tendency to draw inappropriate conclusions based on small data samples or a small number of examples |
| Self-serving biases | Tendency to make attributions about causes of behavior that are self-serving (take personal credit for successes, blame aspects of the situation for negative results) |
| Endowment effect | Tendency to inflate the value of something you own or have in your possession |
| Ignoring others' cognitions | Failure to consider the other party's thoughts and perceptions, inhibiting an accurate understanding of their interests and goals |
| Reactive devaluation | Placing less value on concessions made by the other side simply because the other party offered them |

### Irrational escalation of commitment

An “escalation of commitment” is making decisions that stick with a failing course of action.

- Even when that commitment constitutes irrational behavior.

Due in part to biases in perception and judgment.

- Negotiators seek supportive evidence and ignore disconfirming evidence.
- Initial commitments become set in stone.
- A desire for consistency prevents changing them—made worse by a desire to save face.

> Fight the bias.
>
> - Use an adviser to serve as a reality check.
> - There may be less desire to escalate if regret is felt following a previous escalation situation.

### Mythical fixed-pie beliefs

Many negotiators assume that all negotiations involve a fixed pie and approach integrative negotiation opportunities as zero-sum situations or win-lose exchanges.

- Negotiators focusing on personal gain are most likely to come under the influence of fixed-pie beliefs while those focusing on values are less likely to see a fixed-pie.


> Fight the bias
>
> - First, by focusing on underlying interests rather than merely on the issues being negotiated, negotiators are more likely to see their fixed-pie perception is misguided.
> - Second, fixed-pie perceptions can be diminished by holding negotiators accountable for the way they negotiate.

### Anchoring and adjustment

Cognitive biases in anchoring and adjustment are related to the effect of the standard (or anchor) against which subsequent adjustments are made during negotiation.

- Anchors can be a trap for the negotiator as the choice of an anchor may be based on faulty or incomplete information and therefore misleading in and of itself.
- Once the anchor is defined, parties tend to treat it as a real, valid benchmark by which to adjust other judgments, such as the size of one side’s opening offer.
- Goals—whether realistic or not—can serve as anchors and may be public or private, as well as conscious or unconscious.

> Fight the bias
> 
> - Thorough preparation
> - the use of a devil’s advocate or reality check
> - both can help prevent errors of anchoring and adjustment.

### Issue Framing and Risk

As discussed earlier, a frame is a perspective or point of view that people use when they gather information and solve problems.

- For instance, people respond quite differently when they are negotiating to “gain” something than when negotiating to “not lose” something.

“Prospect theory” holds that people are more risk-averse when a problem is framed as a possible gain, and risk-seeking when framed as a loss.

- When negotiators are risk-averse, they are more likely to accept any viable offer simply because they are afraid of losing.
- In contrast, when negotiators are risk-seeking, they are apt to wait for a better offer or for further concessions.

This positive/negative framing process is important as the same offer can elicit markedly different courses of action depending on how it is framed in gain-loss terms.

> Fight the bias
> 
> - awareness of the bias
> - sufficient information
> - thorough analysis
> - reality checks
> - can be difficult to achieve as frames are often tied to deeply held values and beliefs or to other anchors that are hard to detect.

### Availability of Information

Negotiators must also be concerned with the potential bias caused by the availability of information or how easy information is to retrieve—check for accuracy.

- The availability of information also affects negotiation through the use of established search patterns and overvaluation of information resulting from those searches.

> Fight the bias
>
> - Check everything for accuracy 

### The Winner’s Curse

The winner’s curse refers to the tendency of negotiators, particularly in an auction setting, to settle quickly on an item and then subsequently feel discomfort about a negotiation win that comes too easily.

- The negotiator may suspect the other party knows too much or has insight into an unseen advantage; and think they could have done better, or the deal is bad.

> Fight the bias
> 
> - The best remedy for the winner’s curse is to prevent it from occurring in the first place.
> - Prepare adequately to prevent making an offer that is unexpectedly accepted.

### Overconfidence

Overconfidence is the tendency of negotiators to believe that their ability to be correct or accurate is greater than is actually true—and has a double-edged effect:

- It can solidify the degree to which negotiators support positions or options that are incorrect or inappropriate, and 
- It can lead negotiators to discount the worth or validity of the judgments of others, in effect shutting down other parties as sources of information, interests, and options necessary for a successful integrative negotiation.

> Fight the bias
> 
> - Study results are mixed.
> - So negotiators should not always suppress confidence or optimism.

### The Law of Small Numbers

In decision theory, the law of small numbers refers to the tendency to draw conclusions from small sample sizes.

- In negotiation, the law of small numbers applies to the way negotiators learn and extrapolate from their own experience.
- If experience is limited in time or scope, the tendency is to extrapolate prior experience onto future negotiations—such as, all negotiations are distributive.

This tendency may lead to a self-fulfilling prophecy – people who expect to be treated in a distributive manner will:

- Be more likely to perceive the other party’s behaviors as distributive, and
- Treat the other party in a more distributive manner.
- Likely be reciprocated with the same distributive treatment by the other party.

> Fight the bias
> 
> - Remember the less experience, the greater the possibility that past lessons will be erroneously used in the future.
> - Styles and strategies that worked in the past may not work in the future.
> - especially if the negotiations differ, which they will.

### Self-Serving Biases

People often explain another person’s behavior by making attributions, either to the person (internal factors: ability, mood, effort) or the situation (external factors: task, other people, fate).

- In explaining other’s behavior, the tendency is to overestimate the role of personal or internal factors and underestimate the role of situational or external factors.
- Perceptual biases are often exacerbated by the actor-observer effect in which people tend to attribute their own behavior to situational factors but attribute other's behaviors to personal factors.
- Perceptual error of a self-serving nature may also involve distortions in the evaluation of information.

  - For instance, the false-consensus effect is a tendency to overestimate the degree of support and consensus that exists for one’s own position, opinions, or behaviors.

> Fight the bias
> 
> - Negotiators subject to this bias may make faulty judgments regarding tactics or outcome probabilities.
> - Just be aware of the bias
> - Use a reality check

### Endowment Effect

The endowment effect is the tendency to overvalue something you own or believe you possess.

- In negotiation, the endowment effect can lead to inflated estimations of value that interfere with reaching a good deal. 
- Negotiators are fine with using the status quo as an anchor, making concessions difficult.

> Fight the bias
> 
> - This is very difficult to fight or defend against.
> - Use a devil's advocate to make sure you are not initiating this effect.

### Ignoring Others' Cognitions

Failure to consider the other party’s cognitions allows negotiators to simplify their thinking about otherwise complex processes; 

- This usually leads to a more distributive strategy and causes a failure to recognize the contingent nature of both sides’ behaviors and responses.

In contrast, when negotiators are able to consider things from the other party’s viewpoint (a cognitive capacity known as “perspective taking”), 

- The risk of impasse is reduced and the chances for integrative outcomes via logrolling is enhanced. 

> Fight the bias
>
> - Training and awareness reduce the effects modestly.
> - This deep-seated drive to ignore the others’ cognitions can be avoided only if negotiators explicitly focus on putting in the effort needed to form an accurate understanding of the other party’s interests, goals, and perspectives.

### Reactive Devaluation

Reactive devaluation is the process of devaluing the other party’s concessions simply because the other party made them—leads negotiators to:

- Minimize the magnitude of a concession made by a disliked other; 
- To reduce their willingness to respond with a concession of equal size; or 
- To seek even more from the other party once a concession has been made.

> Fight the bias
>
> - Maintaining an objective view of the process, 
> - Assigning a colleague to do this task, 
> - Clarifying each side’s preferences on options and concessions before any are made,
> - Using a third party to mediate or filter concession-making processes.

### Managing Misperceptions and Cognitive Biases in Negotiation

Misperceptions and cognitive biases typically arise out of conscious awareness as negotiators gather and process information.

- The first level of managing such distortions is to be aware that they can occur.
- Awareness may not be enough—simply knowing about them does little to counteract their effects.
- More research is needed to provide effective advice, but until then:

  - Be aware of the existence of these biases, 
  - Understand their negative effects, and
  - Be prepared to discuss them when appropriate with your own team and with counterparts.

## Mood, Emotion and Negotiation

The role of mood and emotion in negotiation has been an increasing body of theory and research during the last two decades.

- The distinction between mood and emotion is based on three characteristics: specificity, intensity, and duration.
- Mood states are more diffuse, less intense, and more enduring than emotion states, which tend to be more intense and targeted.
- Emotions play important roles at various stages of negotiation.

### Research findings in the study of mood, emotion and negotiation

- Negotiations create both positive and negative emotions.
- Positive emotions generally have positive consequences.
- Aspects of the process can lead to positive emotions.
- Negative emotions generally have negative consequences.

  - They may lead to defining the situation as competitive.
  - They may undermine the ability to analyze the situation accurately.

- Negative emotions may lead parties to escalate the conflict.
- Negative emotions may lead to retaliation and discourage integrative outcomes.
- Not all negative emotions have the same effect.

  - Negotiators make smaller demands of worried or disappointed opponents. 
  - But fewer concessions to guilty or regretful opponents.

### The effects of positive and negative emotion in negotiation

Positive feelings may have negative consequences.

- Negotiators in a positive mood may be susceptible to deceptive tactics.
- And achieve less-optimal outcomes.
- If there is no agreement, defeat may be harsh and counterproductive.

Negative feelings may create positive outcomes.

- Generally, well expressed anger can lead to positive outcomes.
- Negative emotion has information value as a danger signal.

Anger may signal toughness, but not always.

- Can work in your favor if the anger is seen as appropriate but it can backfire.
- Less likely to work with a deceiver or one who has little at stake to begin with.

> Negative emotion can benefit powerful negotiators, but provides less focus and poorer outcomes for low-power negotiators.

### Emotions can be used strategiclly as negotiation gambits

Emotions may be used strategically as influence tactics in negotiation.

- Negotiators exhibiting positive emotionality were more likely to induce compliance with ultimatum offers.
- A negotiator displaying sadness elicits concern from the other party and can extract concessions and claim value.

  - Works only when displayed by those with low-power.
  - Emotional manipulation does not work for high-power negotiators.

> Negotiators may also engage in the regulation or management of the emotions of the other party.
> 
> - Effective negotiators adjust their messages to adapt to what they perceive as the other party’s emotional state.
> 
>  - Known as emotional intelligence.
