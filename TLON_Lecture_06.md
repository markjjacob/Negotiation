# The Language of Negotiation - Perception, Cognition, Emotion

## Chapter Overview

We begin by examining how psychological **perception** is related to the process of negotiation, with attention to forms of perceptual distortion.

We then look at how negotiators use information to make decisions about tactics and strategy—the process of **cognition**.

- First, we focus on framing—the strategic use of information to define and articulate a negotiating issue or situation.  
- Second, we discuss cognitive biases in information processing.

We experience and express **emotion** when we interact with others and negotiating is certainly no exception.

- In the final section, we discuss the role of moods and emotions in negotiation—both as causes of behavior and as consequences of negotiated outcomes.

## Perception Defined

Perception is the process by which individuals connect to their environment, by ascribing meaning to messages and events.

Perception is a “sense-making” process where people interpret their environment so they can respond appropriately.

         +----------------------------------------------+
```

> Environments are typically complex, so as perceivers we become selective

### Perceptual Distortion

> *Stereotyping*

- Occurs when a person assigns attributes to another solely on the basis of the other'S social or demographic category.
- Once formwd, sterotypes can be highly resistant to change

> *Halo effects*

- Occur when people generalize about a variety of attributes based on the knowledge of one attribute of the individual.
- Can be positive or negative.

> *Selective perveption*

- Occurs when perceivers single out supporting information and filter out information that does not confirm their beliefs.
- Perpetuates sterotypes or halo effects.

> Projection

- Occurs when people assign to others the characteristics or feelings that they possess themselves.
- Usually arises out of a need to project one's own self-concept

### Framing

A frame is a subjective mechanism allowing people to evaluate situations, leading them to pursue or avoid subsequent actions.

- Two or more people involved in the same situation or in a complex problem often see it or define it in different ways.
- These frames can change depending on perspective, or they can change over time.

How parties frame an issue is a reflection of:

- WHat they see as critical to their objectives
- Their outcome expectations and preferences.
- What information they need to argue their case.
- Procedures they use to present their case.
- The manner in which they evaluate outcomes.

> Frames are inevitable, occurring without any real intention by the negotiator.

### Types of frames

| Type of Frame    | Definition                 |
| ---------------- |:--------------------------:|
| Substantive      | What the conflict is about |
| Outcome          | A party's predisposition to achieving a specific result or outcome from the negotiation |
| Aspiration       | A predisposition to satisfying a broader set of interests or needs in negotiation |
| Process          | How the parties will go about resolving their dispute |
| Identity         | How the parties define who they are |    
| Characterization | How the parties define the other parties |
| Loss or gain     | How the parties define the risk or reward associated with particular outcomes |

### How frames work in negotiation

- Negotiators can use more than one frame.
- Mismatches in frames between parties are sources of conflict.
- Parties negotiate differently depending on the frame.
- Specific frames may be likely to be used with certain types of issues.
- Particular types of frames may lead to particular types of agreements.
- Parties are likely to assume a particular frame because of various factors.
  - Differences in values, personality, power, or background and social context may lead parties to adopt different frames.

### Another approach to frames: interests rights and power

An influential approach to framing disputes suggests that parties in conflict use one of three frames:

- Interests.

  - People are often concerned about what they need, desire, or want.

- Rights.

  - People may also be concerned about who is “right”—that is, who has legitimacy, who is correct, or what is fair.

- Power.

  - Power is sometimes based on who is physically stronger, but more often, it is about imposing other types of costs – economic pressures, expertise, legitimate authority, and so on.

The way a party frames the problem will likely influence how the other party responds.

### The frame of an issue changes as the negotiation evolves

Disputes tend to transform through “naming, blaming, and claiming.”

- *Naming* occurs when parties in a dispute label or identify a problem and characterize what it is about.
- *Blaming* occurs next, as the parties try to determine who or what caused the problem.
- Finally, *claiming* occurs when the individual who has the problem decides to confront, file charges, or take some other action against the individual or organization that caused the problem.

Frames are shaped by the bargaining mix.

- Arguing stock issues.
- Arguing the best possible case.
- They may define major shifts and transitions. 
- Finally, multiple agenda items shape frames.

> Critical to issue development is the process of reframing—changes to the thrust, tone, and focus of a conversation.

## Cognition

### Cognitive biases - irrational escalation of commitment

An “escalation of commitment” is making decisions that stick with a failing course of action.

- Even when that commitment constitutes irrational behavior.

Due in part to biases in perception and judgment.

- Negotiators seek supportive evidence and ignore disconfirming evidence.
- Initial commitments become set in stone.
- A desire for consistency prevents changing them—made worse by a desire to save face.

Fight the bias.

- Use an adviser to serve as a reality check.
- There may be less desire to escalate if regret is felt following a previous escalation situation.

## Mood, Emotion and Negotiation

The role of mood and emotion in negotiation has been an increasing body of theory and research during the last two decades.

- The distinction between mood and emotion is based on three characteristics: specificity, intensity, and duration.
- Mood states are more diffuse, less intense, and more enduring than emotion states, which tend to be more intense and targeted.
- Emotions play important roles at various stages of negotiation.

### Research findings in the study of mood, emotion and negotiation

- Negotiations create both positive and negative emotions.
- Positive emotions generally have positive consequences.
- Aspects of the process can lead to positive emotions.
- Negative emotions generally have negative consequences.

  - They may lead to defining the situation as competitive.
  - They may undermine the ability to analyze the situation accurately.

- Negative emotions may lead parties to escalate the conflict.
- Negative emotions may lead to retaliation and discourage integrative outcomes.
- Not all negative emotions have the same effect.

  - Negotiators make smaller demands of worried or disappointed opponents. 
  - But fewer concessions to guilty or regretful opponents.

### The effects of positive and negative emotion in negotiation

Positive feelings may have negative consequences.

- Negotiators in a positive mood may be susceptible to deceptive tactics.
- And achieve less-optimal outcomes.
- If there is no agreement, defeat may be harsh and counterproductive.

Negative feelings may create positive outcomes.

- Generally, well expressed anger can lead to positive outcomes.
- Negative emotion has information value as a danger signal.

Anger may signal toughness, but not always.

- Can work in your favor if the anger is seen as appropriate but it can backfire.
- Less likely to work with a deceiver or one who has little at stake to begin with.

> Negative emotion can benefit powerful negotiators, but provides less focus and poorer outcomes for low-power negotiators.

### Emotions can be used strategiclly as negotiation gambits

Emotions may be used strategically as influence tactics in negotiation.

- Negotiators exhibiting positive emotionality were more likely to induce compliance with ultimatum offers.
- A negotiator displaying sadness elicits concern from the other party and can extract concessions and claim value.

  - Works only when displayed by those with low-power.
  - Emotional manipulation does not work for high-power negotiators.

> Negotiators may also engage in the regulation or management of the emotions of the other party.
> 
> - Effective negotiators adjust their messages to adapt to what they perceive as the other party’s emotional state.
> 
>  - Known as emotional intelligence.
