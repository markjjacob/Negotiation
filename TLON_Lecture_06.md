# The Language of Negotiation - Perception, Cognition, Emotion

## Chapter Overview

We begin by examining how psychological perception is related to the process of negotiation, with attention to forms of perceptual distortion. 
We then look at how negotiators use information to make decisions about tactics and strategy—the process of cognition. 
First, we focus on framing—the strategic use of information to define and articulate a negotiating issue or situation.  
Second, we discuss cognitive biases in information processing. 
We experience and express emotion when we interact with others and negotiating is certainly no exception.
In the final section, we discuss the role of moods and emotions in negotiation—both as causes of behavior and as consequences of negotiated outcomes.
