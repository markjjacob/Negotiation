## 1. Be Prepared

Preparation cannot be overemphasized and leads to several advantages.

- Understanding your own interests and BATNA.
- Analyzing the other party’s offers effectively and efficiently.
- Understanding the nuances of the concession-making process.
- Allowing you the ability to achieve your negotiation goals.

Preparation should occur before the negotiation begins.

- Understand your own goals and interests and articulate them skillfully.
- Understand the other party’s communication and needs.

Good preparation means setting high but achievable outcome aspirations.

- Plan your opening statements and positions carefully.
- Over-planning is not a good use of preparation time.

Prepare by understanding your own strengths and weaknesses, your needs and interests, the situation, and the other party then adjust promptly and effectively as the negotiation proceeds.

## 2. Diagnose the Fundamental Structure of the Negotiation

Assess whether you are in a distributive or an integrative negotiation.

- Choose your strategies and tactics accordingly, as using mismatched strategies and tactics leads to suboptimal outcomes.

  - This leaves money and opportunity on the negotiating table.

Remember, negotiations consist of a blend of integrative and distributive elements and phases.

- Be careful when transitioning between phases as missteps can lead to confusion or impasse.

> At times, accommodation, avoidance, and compromise may be appropriate strategies.

## 3. Identify and Work the BATNA

The best alternative to a negotiated agreement (BATNA) is especially important as this is likely the outcome should agreement not be reached.

- Know what your BATNA is relative to a possible agreement and consciously work to improve the BATNA, and improve the deal.

- Without a strong BATNA you may find it difficult to achieve a good agreement.

  - The other party may try to push you aggressively, and you may be forced to accept an unsatisfying agreement.

You need to be aware of the other’s BATNA and identify how it compares to what you are offering.

- Monitor it to retain your competitive advantage.
- Remind the other negotiator how your offer relates to their BATNA.
- Subtly suggest the other’s BATNA may not be as strong as they think

## 4. Be Willing to Walk Away

The goal of negotiation is a valued outcome, not just ‘an agreement’

- Strong negotiators are willing to walk away if the following happens.

- No agreement is better than a poor agreement.
- When the process is so offensive that the deal isn’t worth the work.
- When they don’t trust the other party to follow through.

Negotiators can focus on an agreement and lose sight of the real goal, which is a good outcome.

- Compare progress with targets set in planning.
- Compare with your walkaway point and BATNA.
- Continue to compare progress and be willing to walk away.

> Even without a good BATNA, you should have a clear walkaway point in mind where you will halt negotiations.

## 5. Master the Key Paradoxes of Negotiation

Negotiation embodies a set of paradoxes and strong negotiators strive for balance when facing these challenges.

- Claiming value versus creating value.
Sticking by your principles versus being resilient enough to go with the flow.
- Sticking with your strategy versus opportunistic pursuit of new options.
- Being too honest and open versus being too closed and opaque.
- Being too trusting versus being too distrusting.
- There is a natural tension in choosing one of the alternatives in a paradox.
- The best approach is to attempt to strike a balance.

### Claiming Value versus Creating Value

All negotiations have a value-claiming stage, and many also have a value-creation stage.

- The skills and strategies appropriate to each stage are quite different.

  - In general terms, distributive skills are useful in the value-claiming stage and integrative skills are useful in value creation.

Typically, the value creation stage precedes the value claiming stage.

- A challenge is to balance emphasis on the two stages and the transition between them.
- One way to manage the transition is to publicly label it.

> Managing this paradox will likely require an overemphasis on discussing the value creation dynamics early in the process.

### Sticking by Your Principles versus Being Resilient Enough to Go with the Flow

Negotiation pace and flow can change, often creating a second paradox.

- Effective negotiation requires flexible thinking.
- On the other hand, you should not easily abandon your core principles.

Effective negotiators are thoughtful about the distinction between:

- Issues of principle where firmness is essential, 
- And issues where compromise is a route to an acceptable outcome.

### Sticking with Your Strategy versus Opportunistically Pursuing New Options

New information frequently comes to light during a negotiation.

- Manage the paradox between sticking with your prepared strategy and pursuing a new opportunity that arises during the process.
- This is a challenging paradox because new “opportunities” may be Trojan horses harboring unpleasant surprises.
- The challenge for negotiators is to distinguish phantom opportunities from real ones—it comes with experience.

Strong preparation is critical to being able to manage the “stay-with-the-current-strategy versus opportunism paradox.

- Well prepared negotiators who understand the circumstances are well positioned to make this judgment and listen to your intuition.

  - If a deal doesn’t feel right, it is probably not a viable option.

### Being Too Honest and Open versus Being Too Closed and Opaque

The dilemma of honesty: How open and honest should I be?

- Negotiators who are completely open risk being taken advantage of.
- Negotiators who are closed gain a negative reputation using an ineffective strategy.

The challenge is deciding how much information to reveal or conceal.

- Remember that negotiation is an ongoing process.
- Positive progress builds trust and comfort revealing information.
- Remember, some information that should probably not be revealed.

  - Such as your bottom line in a distributive negotiation.

### Being Too Trusting versus Being Too Distrusting

The *dilemma of trust*: How much can I trust what the other party tells me?

- If you believe everything the other party tells you, you are vulnerable.
- On the other hand, if you believe nothing, there is no agreement.

Remember that negotiation is a process that evolves over time.

- Build trust by being honest and sharing information with the other side.
- This may lead to reciprocal trust and credible disclosure by the other.

Moreover, there are individual differences in trust.

- Some negotiators are more trusting than others.

There is no right or wrong approach to managing this dilemma.

- Strong negotiators are aware and consciously monitor how they are managing this challenge

## 6. Remember the Intangibles

Intangibles frequently affect negotiation in a negative way, and often operate outside of awareness.

- The best way to identify the existence of intangible factors is to try to see what is not transparently there.
- Often negotiators do not learn what intangible factors are influencing the other negotiator unless the other chooses to disclose them

> There are at least two more ways to discover intangibles that might be affecting the other.
>
> - One way is to ask questions.
> - A second way is to take an observer or listener with you to the negotiation.

> Remember that intangibles influence your own behavior.

## 7. Actively Manage Coalitions--Those against You, for You, and Unknown

Strong negotiators work to capture a strong, supportive coalition.

- If this is not possible, negotiators need to work to prevent the other party from capturing a loose coalition for their own purposes.

Recognize when coalitions are aligned against you and work consciously to counter their influence.

- This may involve a divide-and-conquer strategy.

Coalitions occur in many formal negotiations, but also have a strong influence in less formal settings.

- Managing coalitions is especially important when negotiators need to rely on other people to implement an agreement.

Strong negotiators need to monitor and manage coalitions proactively.

## 8. Savor and Protect Your Reputation

Starting negotiations with a positive reputation is essential, and negotiators should be vigilant in protecting their reputations.

- Consider these contrasting reputations: tough but fair versus tough and devious.
- Negotiators prepare differently for each of these contrasting reputations.

> You can work to shape and enhance your reputation by acting in a consistent and fair manner.
>
> - Consistency gives the other party a clear set of expectations about how you will behave, leading to a stable reputation.
> - Fairness sends the message that you are principled and reasonable.
>
> Strong negotiators seek feedback about the way they are perceived and use that information to strengthen their credibility and trustworthiness.

## 9. Remember That Rationality and Fairness Are Relative

People tend to view the world in a self-serving manner and define the “rational” thing to do or a “fair” outcome in a way that benefits themselves.

- Be aware of this tendency in both themselves and the other party and do three things to manage these perceptions proactively.

  - Question your perceptions and ground them in clear principles.
Find external benchmarks and examples that suggest fair outcomes.
Illuminate definitions of fairness and reach consensus on which standards of fairness apply in a given situation.

Reasonable people can disagree, the outcome negotiators can achieve is:

- A common, agreed-upon perspective.
- Definition of the facts.
- Agreement on the right way to see a problem.
- A standard for determining what is a fair outcome or process.

## 10. Continue to Learn from Your Experience

The best negotiators continue to learn from the experience because no two negotiations are identical.

- A “master negotiator” is a person who has a blend of intelligence, attitudes, and skills.

In addition, the best negotiators analyze each negotiation after it has concluded, to review what happened and what they learned.

- Plan a personal reflection time after each negotiation.
- Periodically “take a lesson” from a trainer or coach.
- Keep track of strengths and weaknesses, and work on weaknesses.
- If you often negotiate against the same person, record their evolution.

Analysis should focus on what, why, and how questions.

- What happened during this negotiation?
- Why did it occur?
- How can I learn from this experience?
