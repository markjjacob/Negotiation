# The Language of Negotiation - Strategy and Planning

> With effective planning and goal setting, most negotiators can achieve their objectives. Without them, results occur more by chance than by effort.

```` ascii

.-------.   .----------.   .----------.
| Goals +-->| Strategy +-->| Planning |
'-------'   '----------'   '----------'

````

> Although the model suggests a linear relationship, many begin midway in the sequence and work backward or forward until the steps are aligned.

## Goals - The focus that drives a negotiation strategy

To determine your goals, consider the following:

- Substantive goals - money
- Intangible goals - winning
- Procedural goals - shaping the agenda

Effective preparation requires negotiators do the following:

- List all goals they wish to achieve.
- Determine the priority among these goals.
- Identify potential multi-goal packages.
- Evaluate possible trade-offs among multiple goals

## Direct effects of goals on choice of strategy

Wishes are not goals, especially in negotiation.

A negotiator’s goals may be linked to the other party’s goals.

There are limits to what realistic goals can be.

Effective goals must be concrete, specific, and measurable.

- If not, it will be hard to communicate what you want, understand what the other party wants, and determine if an offer satisfies your goals.

> Goals can be intangible or procedural.
> 
> - Intangible goals might include maintaining a reputation, or establishing a precedent.
> 
> - A procedural goal might be that the other negotiator must make at least two concessions to convince you of their sincerity.

>> Criteria used to determine goals depend on your objectives and your priorities among multiple goals.

## Indirect effect of goals on choice of strategy

Short-term thinking affects our choice of strategy.
We may ignore the present or future relationship with the other party in a concern for achieving a substantive outcome only.

Goals requiring a substantial change in the other party’s attitude may require a long-range plan.

- Progress may be incremental and require a strong relationship with the other party.
- Relationship-oriented goals should motive the negotiator toward a strategy valuing the relationship as much as the outcome.

>> Relational goals tend to support the choice of a collaborative or integrative strategy.

## Strategy versus tactics

How are strategy and tactics related?

- One major difference is that of scale, perspective, or immediacy.

  - Tactics are short-term, adaptive moves designed to enact broad strategies.
  - Which in turn, provide stability, continuity, and direction for tactical behaviors.
  - Tactics are subordinated to strategy. They are structured, directed, and driven by strategic considerations.

## Accomodation, Competition and Collaboration

Accommodation is as much a win-lose strategy as competition.

- The imbalance is in the opposite direction – I lose, you win.
- Used to build or strengthen a relationship.

  - They expect a future “tit for tat” accommodation from the other.
  - Reciprocity may be the glue holding social groups together.
  - For a long-term relationship, consider accommodative moves early to build trust and to be able to ask for “reciprocity” in the future.
