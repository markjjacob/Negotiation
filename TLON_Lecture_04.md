# The Language of Negotiation - Strategy and Planning

> With effective planning and goal setting, most negotiators can achieve their objectives. Without them, results occur more by chance than by effort.

.-------.   .----------.   .----------.
| Goals +-->| Strategy +-->| Planning |
'-------'   '----------'   '----------'

> Although the model suggests a linear relationship, many begin midway in the sequence and work backward or forward until the steps are aligned.

## Goals - The focus that drives a negotiation strategy

To determine your goals, consider the following:

- Substantive goals - money
- Intangible goals - winning
- Procedural goals - shaping the agenda

Effective preparation requires negotiators do the following:

- List all goals they wish to achieve.
- Determine the priority among these goals.
- Identify potential multi-goal packages.
- Evaluate possible trade-offs among multiple goals

## Direct effects of goals on choice of strategy
